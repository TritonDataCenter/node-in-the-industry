  When our vintage Rails stack began to buckle under the weight of a global audience, I replaced it with Node. Like other media producers, I realize that the market is changing: anyone, anywhere in the world could be listening to our content, and we need to pick the right technologies in order to survive. Node was the right choice for our CMS, media analytics, and distribution platforms. It gets out of the way, and allows me to focus on my primary goal: creating great radio.
