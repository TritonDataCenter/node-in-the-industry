  Node.js allows NitroPCR to easily manage patient care reports for customers
  across thousands of mobile devices. Node's non-blocking network model allows us
  to serve and scale to thousands of connected mobile clients using a REST API
  with no performance hits, all while running on modest cloud based virtual servers.
